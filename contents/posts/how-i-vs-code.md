## 0.1. Why use a Code Editor?

For the same reason some teachers allow cheatsheets and don't take off for formatting: **So you can focus on the relevant task**.
It's not efficient to constantly think about the syntax of your program, and it's especially not efficient to constantly hunt for bugs and errors.
A few features in text editors that I now take for granted are autosaving, autocompletion & suggestion, syntax highlighting and syntax correction.

In this post I'll focus on how I set up my VS Code to help decrease my cognitive load when coding in Python & Javascript (And some bonus tips for blogging / READMEs with Markdown).
I'll go over relevant extensions for each, and try to discuss different settings options you may prefer.

**NOTE:** I personally find VS Code more friendly for new users than older text editors like Emacs and Vi, but those are still incredibly powerful and customizable.
It also has significant community extension support.
In fact, this post was partially inspired and is partially fueled by ["How I VSCode"](https://howivscode.com/about) a 100% open-source VS Code extension by [Scott W](scottw.com) that generates a simple public profile to share the extensions you use.
Here's mine: [howivscode.com/gerardrbentley](https://howivscode.com/gerardrbentley).

## 0.2. First Steps

- **Download:**
A VS Code download for your system should be available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads).
If you need additional directions on downloading and installing, Microsoft already has an [extensive guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) on using VS Code that I'll reference a bit.
- **Open Code:**
I recommend using your OS's search (probably `cmd + spacebar`, `windows key`, or `super key`) and just typing 'code' for nearly instant access without moving your mouse.
- **New Project Folder:**
For this demo we'll only be making a few files, but we still need to make a folder to contain them and for VS Code to pay attention to.
You can name it anything and put it anywhere, I recommend `/vscodetests/` and putting it on your Desktop.
- **New File:**
We'll start with Python, as I'll be discussing fewer moving parts than the Javascript example (both can be notoriously difficult to install, configure, run, etc. especially for beginners, that's why I'm recording these notes!).
I usually Right-Click on the name of the folder to put the file in and select `New File`; name it something like `basic_python.py`.
