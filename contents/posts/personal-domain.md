## Why make your own website?

Your own digital footprint!
The world is becoming more and more digital, so why not leave your mark?
Nowadays you can access a website from anywhere on pretty much any device, it's something simple and personal you can show your friends / co-workers. 
It's a pretty cool feeling to see code you wrote on someone else's screen, plus it can spark new ideas and stick in people's minds.

If you don't mind having a slightly less custom domain then there are plenty of free options that will host your site as a subdomain. In fact this site is accessible at [https://gerardrbentley.gitlab.io/](https://gerardrbentley.gitlab.io/), which is the way I set it up with [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/#getting-started) where I host this project's [code](https://gitlab.com/gerardrbentley/gerardrbentley.gitlab.io).
If you happen to want to know a bit more about how domains actually work, [this](https://whatismyipaddress.com/domain-name) is a decent starter.

A custom domain (website) name goes for around $12 USD per year, but students can get 3! free domains with [The Github dev pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (highly recommended if you're eligible). 
I use [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) for this domain ([gerardbentley.com](gerardbentley.com)) mostly because I trust they won't have any hidden fees, won't leak my credit card info, and will be reliable.
Feel free to use [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/) or any other domain name service you prefer.
Custom domains are limited to one owner, so don't be disappointed if someone else got what you wanted first (capitalism!).

**NOTE** Plenty of businesses these days probably pop up in your ads (unless you use [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)) telling you how easy it is to build a site with them, but that's not what this guide is about. Wix, Squarespace, and Wordpress are valid tools on their own, but this method of building a site uses tools that will be useful in more general software development (HTML, JavaScript, Continuous Integration / Deployment tools).
