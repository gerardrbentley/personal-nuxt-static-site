[[https://gitlab.com/][Gitlab]] is a tool for individuals and teams to host their code for a project in a common location (Repository).

[[https://github.com/][Github]] is an extremely similar and probably still more popular service. Fewer features than gitlab, but still gets the job done of preserving and sharing code.

Both rely on [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control][git]] in the background and on your local computer to maintain the history of all the files (details aren't super important, but impact is)

We have our own instance of gitlab [[https://pom-itb-gitlab01.campus.pomona.edu/faim-lab][here]] that is only accessible on Pomona wifi / VPN.
You should be able to log in with the button labelled
#+BEGIN_VERSE
'Sign in with'
"Claremont CAS"
#+END_VERSE

Our FAIM projects are under the faim-lab group and should all be accessible to you.
We'll use this to keep track of our goals, bugs, and progress on each project with the Issue Boards.

In order to push and pull code from gitlab you'll need to set up an SSH key on your local computer.
Good instructions can be found at [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair]].
Your settings page should look like this:
