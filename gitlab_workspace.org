[[https://gitlab.com/][Gitlab]] is a tool for individuals and teams to host their code for a project in a common location (Repository).

[[https://github.com/][Github]] is an extremely similar and probably still more popular service. Fewer features than gitlab, but still gets the job done of preserving and sharing code.

Both rely on [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control][git]] in the background and on your local computer to maintain the history of all the files (details aren't super important, but impact is)

We have our own instance of gitlab [[https://pom-itb-gitlab01.campus.pomona.edu/faim-lab][here]] that is only accessible on Pomona wifi / VPN.
You should be able to log in with the button labelled
#+BEGIN_VERSE
'Sign in with'
"Claremont CAS"
#+END_VERSE

Our FAIM projects are under the faim-lab group and should all be accessible to you.

We'll use this to keep track of our goals, bugs, and progress on each project with the Issue Boards.

* Action Item

In order to push and pull code from gitlab you'll need to set up an SSH key on your local computer (understanding SSH isn't super important, basically it's to secure the connection over the internet).

Good instructions can be found at [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair]]. I'll summarize here:

- Open a [[file:terminal.org][Terminal]] window
- Type the following command followed by Enter, then use Enter to confirm default settings unless you know you have another ed25519 Key. It’s a best practice to use a password, but it’s not required and you can skip creating it by pressing Enter twice.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "gitlab-faim"
#+END_SRC
- Type the following in the Terminal, followed by Enter,
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#+END_SRC

Now the key you just created is saved in your clipboard (essentially cmd+c / copy) and you should follow these (from the link above)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Add your public SSH key to your GitLab account by:

-Clicking your avatar in the upper right corner and selecting Settings.
-Navigating to SSH Keys and pasting your public key from the clipboard into the Key field. 
-Click the Add key button.
#+END_QUOTE

Afterwards your settings page should look like this (with 1 key instead of 2) and you're ready to [[file:gitlab_workflow][contribute code]]!:
