You can use any text editing software you like (even google docs) to write code.
However, specific code editor programs are great at helping you code more efficiently and with fewer errors.
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]: Older text-based style, but a great long-term investment to learn and recommended by Prof Osborn
- [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]]: Very popular and modern, easier to set up and get used to than emacs. Wide support online and on youtube

For the sake of choice here are some other commonly used programs:
- [[https://atom.io/][Atom]]: Also pretty popular, I prefer VS code, pretty similar experience
- [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][Sublime]]: Never used it, but still somewhat relevant
- [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/][PyCharm]]: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specificly for python, I've never felt the need to use it but if you're just trying out python it may help

When you've chosen one and downloaded it you're ready to contribute on [[file:gitlab_workspace][gitlab]]
